# RedBluff
The goal of this project is to attempt to project what is going on with the triassic Red Bluff (TRb) near Norris, MT under the surface using only surface measurements. This is done through strike and dip measurements taken in the field, and both calculated and published measurements from existing maps. The field work for this project was completed during the summer of 2022.

Calculated measurements were found with three point problems. 
In the Bedding csv, the Z data is in meters and the bedding measurements are recorded using the RHR.



Code for original 3D terrain model based off '3D terrain modeling in python' published by geodose that was adapted to read and parse the data using pandas. This is found at https://www.geodose.com/2019/09/3d-terrain-modelling-in-python.html

Eventually I will add in the python script. For now this is where I am organizing my CSVs.
