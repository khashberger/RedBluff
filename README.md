# RedBluff
Repository for the data collected summer 2022. 
The goal of this project is to attempt to project what is going on with the triassic Red Bluff (TRb) near Norris, MT under the surface using only surface measurements. This is done through strike and dip measurements taken in the field, and both calculated and published measurements from existing maps.
Calculated measurements were found with three point problems. 
In the Bedding csv, the Z data is in meters and the bedding measurements are recorded using the RHR.
